I'm a **Software Developer** at **IAV GmbH** in Berlin, specializing in **automotive infotainment systems** and robust backend development.

My tech stack focuses on:

- JVM languages: `Java`, `Kotlin`, `Groovy`
- Also experienced with: `Python`, `C`, `C++`, `Assembler`

All of my public projects are **test-driven** and emphasize clarity, performance, and maintainability.
