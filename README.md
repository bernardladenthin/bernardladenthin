### ⚙️ Featured Projects

#### 🧠 [BitcoinAddressFinder](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/BitcoinAddressFinder)
A high-performance JVM + OpenCL tool that generates and checks Bitcoin & altcoin addresses — designed for cryptographic edge-case exploration and performance experiments.  
Focuses on:
- Parallel EC key generation
- Vanity address search
- Efficient LMDB database integration

#### 🔄 [streambuffer](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/streambuffer)  
A test-driven, thread-safe streaming buffer that connects an `OutputStream` to an `InputStream` — enabling real-time, bidirectional data flow.  
Key features:  
- Supports concurrent reads and writes  
- Automatic buffer trimming and memory optimization  
- Optional safe-write mechanism (clone-on-write for immutable data)  
- Suitable for embedded systems, protocol parsers, and streaming pipelines
